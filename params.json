{"name":"impressionist","body":"### Hey there!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThanks for checking out impressionist. impressionist is a visual tool that enables you to create impress.js presentations in a visual, easy to use way.Impressionist is conceptualized and developed by Harish Sivaramakrishnan and is under open development on github. Please feel free to watch / fork / log issues.\r\n\r\n### Why did I build impressionist?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nImpress.js expects you to have a reasonably good knowledge of programming with HTML and CSS to make presentations that look good. If you don't do HTML/CSS, impress.js is not for you. Impressionist is an effort to change that. Impressionist has a user interface very similar to powerpoint / keynote which will reduce your learning curve. The orchestration lets you author gorgeous transitions for your presentations visually by leveraging the brilliant 3D/2D transforms that impress.js brings along.\r\n\r\nWriting presentations should be fun, and a visual tool can surely help!\r\n\r\n### Sounds good, can I start using it already?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nYES. You can start using impressionist to build your presentations. However, it still has some distance to go before it becomes release quality. Expect to find bugs as you use it :) Impressionist is opensource under MIT license - Do help out fixing issues.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT: impressionist is currently supported on webkit based browsers (Chrome / Safari) only.
